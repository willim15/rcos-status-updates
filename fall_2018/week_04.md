## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I didn't get the much work done on the front end landing page. But I was
able to learn some functionality uses of React JS and also HTML. I'm beginning to understand 
the uses of React JS and it's been a lot of documentation reading and youtube tutorials of the
overall problems.
	-https://devdocs.io/react/
	-https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_tutorial.pdf
	-https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
I looked at these websites but didn't fully get to read everything on each site. There are a 
lot of different documentation and it can be daunting at times. We finished the wireframe and the presentation for it.

## This Week's Plan
This weeks plan is to start the landing page for the website. Maybe encorporate ReactJS and other 
Javascript libraries but I'm not completely sure what to do yet. 


## Anything Blocking?
There's still a bit of a learning curve to the overall front end development. But it's been a lot
of fun learning the different techonologies.

## Notes
I have a final round interview with Bank of America next week :)
