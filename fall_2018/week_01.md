## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Set up the environment and started looking up the different requirements for creating a
Django Website. Created a figma account to deal with the front end mock ups.

## This Week's Plan

This week's plan is to start the basic website in Django with Dylan. I will start learning the
software Figma in order to create the wireframe and plan for the website. Dylan and I are going
to collaborate outside of Rcos in order to find out the most efficient and best way to go about
creating the starting website.
	-Django (basic website)
	-React possibly using this for the front end.
	-Node JS I used before so I'm looking into the differences with Django.

Django: Want to make user/profile creation possible.
	-Profile Creation
	-Tools Management
	-Profile Settings
	-Different Developer/User Sites

## Anything Blocking?

We still are not completely sure how to create the basic website. Also, the bigger picture image of how we wll connect the financial tools and back testing server is still a little bit vague to me. Also, I think that we need to create a brand image and logo but I'll leave that for after we are done.

## Notes
I'm going to start making mockups for the logo and different webframe projects.
	-Figma for sharing the finished project (live updates for anybody working on it)
	-After Effects: basic animation for the front page
	-Illustrator: 2D vectors and different shapes
	-Cinema4D: For possible 3D mockups.
