## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week is the week of thanksgiving break and I was able to get a lot of different visual and graphic assets done for the project.
There are a lot of different iterations of the logo that I went through and I'm going to make a poll and an update for anyone that 
wants to weigh in on the creative direction of the website. That way I cann get the most feedback from the team and get impact.
The difference between a lot of the graphical assets were color, tone, and readability
Iteration 1:
	- Baby Blue Circle with drop shadow
	- Roboto Type Font with a -12 weight
	- Two Opacity H's within the circle
	- #7cb0ff color profile
This is one of the final drafts which I decided to go with because there's an easier readibility and recognizable factor.
I'm feeling hesitant on this because I feel like it doesn't have the color tone of a professional financial trading strategy. So 
I'm going to raise the hue a little bit to compensate for that.

I've also decided to create a series of different graphics for the front landing page of the website. I've gotten a bunch of stock 
images that will be usefull with ticker and financial ticker photos. These are just base photos that I will edit in the future but I needed
to get something since I haven't been able to make anything in the meantime. 
	-I've set aside three different blank squares in the HTML in order to fill in the graphics.
	-I started animating a graphic to explain the purpose of the website


## This Week's Plan
Continue adding on to the graphics that I've started.
	- I've been needing to add a lot of hot fixes to the animations
	- Continute trying to do new animations
	- Learn some Cinema4d modeling 
	- HTML Graphic Implementaions

## Anything Blocking?
Learning some new programs but I've been watching a lot of different tutorials.
