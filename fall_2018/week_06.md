## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week Dylan and I created the HTML webpages with Bootstrap. We were able to fully create the different pages and
then look up to see what changes need to come.

## This Week's Plan
Create most of the graphics for the landing page of the website.
	-This includes logo
	-Png Files of the different Graphics
	-Mission Statement
	-Different Features

## Anything Blocking?
We were able to get through most of the hurdles of choosing how to create the website. Like using React or Bootstrap. We
ended up just using Bootstrap because of installation problems since we were running on Windows in an Ubuntu window.  

## Notes
What we need to do is look into the different graphics and layout of the website.
