## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I decided to work with Dylan in learning some Django and learn how the REST API will interact with the website. I was able to gain more knowledge on behind how the tools are created and how they access onto the website.

## This Week's Plan

This week I hope to finish the presentation on the wireframe I started last week. That way people can learn about how the website flow will work and function. Also, create the final Django Template.

## Anything Blocking?

Again, I'm still learning how to use Django so I don't always know how all the puzzle pieces connect together.
