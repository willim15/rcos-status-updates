## Last Week's Accomplishments
I was able to accomplish a lot during this last week. Starting with front end website we were able to create all of the pages that appeared in our final demo of the website.
DJANGO & HTML PAGES:
We created three different containers on the landing page that would display graphics that resembled from the wireframe. We had to create different sized containers and values that were able to hold these photos. Also, I think that this is pretty self explanatory for future members to jump into and edit because they are pretty clearly labeled. 
The about page is very similar to the landing page where I was able to create two containers that would hold the remaining infographics about hedgehogs. Dylan and I then moved to fixing the sign up and login page. At first everything was left justified and it was simple text boxes. 
We changed some of the buttons to have a blue highlight when you hover as well as centering everything. We made all the text and options to be under a smaller container that would resemble most other login and sign up pages. We also create color accents around certain boxes to match the overal titanium white/cool blue color pallete. Finally we then just changed a lot of the website to have the same Roboto font and have the same greys and whites throughout the website. A lot of the graphics works that would be displayed was then up to me to create and then add to the website.
DESIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
All of the graphics on the website were created by me and then I made templates that would house the original photoshop/illustrator/aftereffects files. Starting with the landing page I made three different graphics that were going to be displayed. It took me a lot of time to try and get the overall design down but also file sizes that would cooperate. I had to compress the maingraphic with an fps of 15 in order for the page to load fast enough with the graphic. That way you wouldn't get the picture rolling down when you load up the page. This took a bit of trial and error but nobody in the future will have this problem because the After Effects project file I created will have the exact composition settings and render settings that I used as a standard.
Most of the other non-moving graphics were then created in photoshop where I had a different file for each container in the website. This will be helpful for whoever decides to edit the text description of some of the graphics or just wants to know certain dimensions of photos within the website.
Most of the files and graphics that I created were made with the intention for future members to be able to quickly change and edit even if they don't have that much experience with these programs. Since everything is put in place with proper guidelines and aspect ratios a lot of the technical nitpicking is already done for them.
DEMO/PRESENTATION:
We presented last week our project to the RCOS community during the largegroup meeting. It was an overall a positive experience but each one of us were not able to talk for that long because there were ten of us. That was alright because a lot of the design work that I did wasn't exactly directly correlated to code unless for implementing a lot of our project. Also, our live project demo went really well and this was most of the front end work done by Dylan and I which was really rewarding to see on the big screen. Overall, I'm happy at what I was able to accomplish.

## This Week's Plan
This week's plan is to tidy up some commits and maybe change some file locations around so we don't have any confusion about what the templates are.
It's bittersweet that our hedgehogs adventures comes to a close this week. Also commit this status update. :D

## Anything Blocking?
At first Dylan and I didn't know where to put the Account information after you logged in. Before we used to have a line of text that would say "Welcome to this page you are signed in as ___________" We wanted to change this because it disrupted the flow of the website and we wanted it to look more professional and not repetititve. We then decided to add the username in parenthesis to the Header that would replace the signup link when logged in. This ended up being more professional looking and had a cleaner design.

## Notes
Many thanks to our out of Campus Project Lead Ranjit and also Professor Turner & Goldschmidt.
Also, thanks to my small group leader Grace Roller. She helped make me understand git better in the beginning of the semester.
