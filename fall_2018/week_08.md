that are contacted within it's shell. It was the first time I was able to explore the different possibilities that this
can open. It's very similar to some basic C++ expressions but it was hard wrapping my head around the constant changing variables
that different effects can do. For example, the positions value can be changed from the keyframe menu which was interesting.

Also, I was able start connecting some of the different graphics into the HTML. It was pretty straight forward which just needed me

that I made.

A lot of the graphics I made were created in Photoshop but then also convereted to After Effects for light animations. Not everything

	-Clean and minimal
