## Last Week's Accomplishments
I had a lot of progress learning after effects and a lot of the different scripting software structures
that are contacted within it's shell. It was the first time I was able to explore the different possibilities that this
can open. It's very similar to some basic C++ expressions but it was hard wrapping my head around the constant changing variables
that different effects can do. For example, the positions value can be changed from the keyframe menu which was interesting.

Also, I was able start connecting some of the different graphics into the HTML. It was pretty straight forward which just needed me
to do look up different coding tutorials on the internet. Not everything was easy because I had resizing issues with the graphics
that I made.

A lot of the graphics I made were created in Photoshop but then also convereted to After Effects for light animations. Not everything 
was changed in terms structure they kept the same core elements:
	-Base Color: Blue
	-Light Color Frame with not much blacks
	-Roboto with -12 weight
	-Clean and minimal 

## This Week's Plan
-Create a finished website for the demo
	-Make sure that the back-end connects thoroughly with the front-end html pages.
A lot of the finished website needs some more graphics that we haven't decided what they're going to be.
There's some mock-ups that we're going to be creating which are going to have their own templates as well.
	-Landing Page animation
	-About Page Starting Graphic
We also need to revamp the login and signup page. They are just base text boxes which need a lot more prettying up.
	-Dylan and I plan to work on those classes together so we can make them look prettier. 

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing is blocking at the moment. We've gotten into the groove and making a lot of progress. It seems like we're right on schedule
to prepare for the demo we need to present. It looks like we are making a lot of progress.

## Notes
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/templates/language/
Started reading up on the templates for Django when designing the website.
	-I'm going to make the header and footer on a seperate page from the about and landing
