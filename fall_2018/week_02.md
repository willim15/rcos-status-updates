## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Worked on the wireframe for the overall look of the website. Met with our project lead Ranjit to discuss
what we should encorporate for the website. So we mapped out how the overall flow of the website will function
and carry out. That way we can have an overall smooth implementation process with how we should budget our time.

Also, the wire frame was built in google draw which was the first time Dylan and I both had used the software.
It was an overall smooth process with not much of any technical hitches. We mapped out the website and moved our
finished tickets in the scrum board.

## This Week's Plan

We finished the website wirefram. Now we are researching the possible uses of Django and how to implement the website.

Django: Want to make user/profile creation possible.
	-Profile Creation
	-Tools Management
	-Profile Settings
	-Different Developer/User Sites

## Anything Blocking?

Just need to start learning basic knowledge behind django. Have never used it before.

## Notes
We might not end up using figma because we have a wireframe created already. I'm also already more comfortable in illustrator and will mostly likely use it
